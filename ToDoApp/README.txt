Welcome to the ToDoApp readme!

The ToDoApp is a small andoid application used to store tasks written by the user in an SQLite database.
In each task you create, you can set the priority (low, medium, or high) as well as category they belong to
(School assignments, House work, or Professional work).

Please open it and take a look using Android Studio. Enjoy!
